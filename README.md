Habit tracker 
The "Life Optimizer": Personal Habit Heatmap
Instead of a simple checklist, build a dashboard that tracks habits (like gym, coding, or reading) and displays them.
The Twist: Add a "Streak Freeze" mechanic where you can earn "saves" for days you’re genuinely too busy.
Tech Stack: React or Vue.js for the frontend, and LocalStorage or Firebase for the data.
